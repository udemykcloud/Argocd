## Mastering ArgoCD for Kubernetes Deployments
***************************************************

# Why ArgoCD?
Argo CD is a specialized tool that enhances Kubernetes deployments by implementing GitOps principles, offering automation, consistency, and scalability that native Kubernetes deployments alone cannot provide.

* GitOps Workflow for Automation
Benefit: Ensures declarative, version-controlled deployments, making rollbacks, audits, and collaboration easier compared to manual kubectl apply commands.

* Continuous Monitoring and Drift Detection

Benefit: By default, Kubernetes doesn’t automatically keep checking that your cluster always matches what you want. If you just use kubectl (the command line tool), you have to manually check if things have changed or broken.

* Simplified Rollbacks and History:
Kubernetes deployments support rollbacks (e.g., kubectl rollout undo), but they lack Git’s version control context, making it harder to track changes or collaborate across teams.
Multi-Cluster and Multi-Environment Management:

Argo CD can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters (e.g., dev, staging, prod) from a single control plane, using different Git repos or branches for each environment.

* Enhanced UI and Visualization
Kubernetes’ native tools (e.g., kubectl describe) are CLI-based and less intuitive for tracking complex deployments across teams.

* Integration with Helm and Other Tools
While Kubernetes supports Helm, applying and managing Helm charts manually or via scripts is less automated than Argo CD’s Git-driven approach.

## Why Are Kubernetes Deployments Alone Not Enough?
* Lack of Automation : Kubernetes deployments require manual kubectl commands or custom scripts to apply changes, which can lead to human errors or inconsistent processes

* No Built-in Drift Detection : Kubernetes doesn’t natively monitor for configuration drift. If someone modifies a resource directly (e.g., via kubectl edit), there’s no automatic way to detect or revert it.

* Limited Version Control : Kubernetes stores resource states in etcd database but doesn’t tie them to a version-controlled system like Git, making it hard to track changes or audit who did what.

* Complex Multi-Cluster Management : Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters (e.g., across AWS EKS regions) requires separate kubectl contexts and manual coordination.

* No Native GitOps Support: Kubernetes doesn’t inherently follow GitOps principles, requiring you to build custom pipelines for declarative, Git-driven deployments.

************************************************************************************************************************************************

## ArgoCD Architecture
ArgoCD is designed as a Kubernetes-native tool that simplifies continuous delivery using the GitOps approach. Its architecture consists of key components that work together to monitor, manage, and deploy applications. Below is a simple breakdown of its architecture, focusing on the core elements, how it integrates with Kubernetes, and its sync policies and reconciliation process.
Application Controller, API Server, and Repository Server

* Application Controller: This is the core component that continuously monitors the state of applications. It compares the live state of applications running in the Kubernetes cluster with the desired state defined in the Git repository. If it detects any differences (called drift), it flags the application as OutOfSync and takes action based on configured policies.
* API Server: The API Server provides a way to interact with ArgoCD. It powers the web user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to view application status, trigger syncs, or manage configurations. It also handles authentication and authorization, integrating with SSO providers like OIDC, LDAP, or GitHub.
* Repository Server: This component fetches and processes the application configurations stored in Git repositories. It supports various formats like YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize, or Jsonnet, and generates the Kubernetes manifests needed for deployment.

## ArgoCD as a Kubernetes Extension


ArgoCD is built as a Kubernetes controller, meaning it runs natively within a Kubernetes cluster and uses Kubernetes APIs to manage resources. It’s installed in a dedicated namespace (typically argocd) and leverages Kubernetes custom resources to define and track applications. This tight integration allows ArgoCD to:

Monitor and manage applications as Kubernetes resources.
Scale with the cluster, handling multiple applications and environments efficiently.
Work seamlessly with existing Kubernetes tools and workflows, making it a natural fit for teams already using Kubernetes.

## Sync Policies and Reconciliation Process

ArgoCD uses a reconciliation loop to ensure the live state of applications matches the desired state in the Git repository. Here's how it works:

Sync Policies: These define how ArgoCD handles synchronization when differences are detected:

* Manual Sync: Users manually trigger synchronization via the UI or CLI to apply changes from the Git repository.
Automated Sync: ArgoCD automatically applies changes from the Git repository to the cluster whenever updates are detected, reducing manual intervention.
* Sync Options: Policies can include settings like pruning (removing resources no longer in Git), self-healing (reverting unauthorized changes), or selective syncing (applying specific resources).


Reconciliation Process: The Application Controller periodically checks the live state against the Git-defined state. If they differ:

ArgoCD identifies the discrepancies (e.g., missing resources, incorrect configurations).
It applies the necessary changes to align the cluster with the Git repository, based on the sync policy.
It supports advanced rollout strategies like blue/green or canary deployments through sync hooks (PreSync, Sync, PostSync).


Visualization and Reporting: ArgoCD’s UI and CLI provide real-time insights into the sync status, showing which applications are in sync, out of sync, or degraded, along with detailed logs and audit trails.

* Install Argo Rollout with canary deployment

Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that enable advanced deployment strategies like canary and blue-green deployments. Unlike standard Kubernetes Deployments, which use a RollingUpdate strategy, Argo Rollouts provides fine-grained control over traffic shifting and automated rollback based on metrics analysis. In a canary deployment, a new version of the application is gradually rolled out to a subset of users, allowing you to monitor its performance before fully promoting it.

## Argo Rollout Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-green deployment runs two versions of your app: the blue version guestbook:blue serves all traffic, while the green version guestbook:green is deployed but receives no traffic until you’re ready to switch. Once verified, you instantly switch all traffic to green, and blue is kept ready for rollback if needed.

# How Blue green deployment works

Blue Phase: 3 pods run blue, and the guestbook-ui service routes 100% traffic to them via the guestbook-ui-ingress.
Green Phase: Deploy 3 pods with green. The guestbook-ui-canary service points to green pods, but no traffic goes there yet.
Switch: When ready, Argo Rollouts updates the guestbook-ui service to point to green pods, instantly switching 100% traffic to green.
Rollback: If green fails, switch back to blue with kubectl argo rollouts abort guestbook-ui -n default.


* Deploy the guestbook rollout
